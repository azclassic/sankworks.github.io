# 📝 Building a Simple To-Do List App with Python

Today, I created a simple terminal-based To-Do List app as part of my Python learning journey.  
While working on this project, I solidified my understanding of lists, dictionaries, loops, and conditionals.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks  
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed  
- ✅ Delete tasks  
- ✅ View all tasks  
- ✅ Exit the program

## 💡 What I Learned (and Fixed)

- `tasks.append({"task": task, "done": False})` ← how to create structured task entries
- `tasks[index]["done"] = True` ← marking completion correctly
- `if not tasks:` ← the clean Pythonic way to check for empty lists

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Save/load to file  
- Add input validation  
- Try building a GUI version with Tkinter!
